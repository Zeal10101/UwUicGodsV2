50,000 Years ago a few sister angels known as ionalns at that time were wandering around the city of UwUs at night when they turned a wrong corner and went into the wrong tavern they were meant to go in and they did not see that they did, later when they were sat down  reading one needed to go to the bathroom and went along but when she stepped in there she heard a loud scream from in there it was someone practicing dark magic so she hid quietly until they left but it was around 20 minutes later when her sister came in and saw that someone was practicing dark magic so the person tried to attack but the sister jumped out and tried to stop the person attacking but she didn't see that it was a demon trying to attack and the demon stabbed her with the horns but the other sister was escaping and went to tell the gods and the demon remembered he cant go out there or he will be attacked so he decided to wait it out when the girl got to the gods they asked what was her name and she said that her name was saysawnay and the gods asked why she was here and she was out of breath to talk so out of breath she passed out so the gods brought her to her home and just left her there by herself but curious why nobody was there because she only seemed around 17 but they ignored that and set her down in her house and went on with there day, when saysawnay woke up she wasnt alone but this was not her sister it was the demon that tried to kill her. Saysawnay woke up on the demons lap wandering were she was at first but then fully opened her eyes she was scared at first but then looking closer she saw it was Allnytishious the god of UwUs but she did not relize it at the time but this would be her worst fear and hope of being happy again she soon wondering why he was in her house and what he was doing while she was a sleep and all he said to why he was in her house was that he made breakfast ignoring what she said she got but still injured from when she fell but wondered when did she fall so she asked thinking she knew he didnt know but still asking and soon coming to figure out that he knew and said to her she was a sleep for 5 days and said well i guess thats why i still hurt so bad wait she said remembering  her neighbor was going to come to clean her home  and she said you nee to leave before he gets hear or there will be an army of people  that hate you soon after when he comes and Allnytishious asked but why and then remembered she lived on the neighborhood that there are a lot of people that hate him for being half demon so she rushed him out to the treehouse in her backyard and said stay here and dont come out i will be right back and nobody ever knew what she did in that time but 20 minutes later she returned. when she returned she was badly injured and so the demon was confused and asked what happened but before she could respond she passed out bleeding the demon knowing he would have to kill her before she remember what happend the demond took a knife and put it next to her throat but before he could kill her someone randomly appeared and told him not to or he would kill him but the demon who was never told someone would kill him took the knife and began to cut her arm  but he only cut a little before the random man shot lightning through his hands and right at him chest and the man took her away. It seemed like the man vanished but all he did was run about 83052 miles in 2 seconds and layed on some table when he got to his place, when saysawnay awoke 5 men in suites awaited her and saysawnay not knowing where she was decided to attack and that causing a fight but the man came in and told them not to fight and she began to relize they would have killed her already if they wanted her dead so she stopped fighting and the man told her to sit down and let me explain, saysawnay was told that she wasnt meant to be in avanlot but the gods made a mistake and brought the wrong person here so he wanted to bring her back to earth but she refused saying she will not go there because she didnt want to, the man saying if you wont go then you will be taught the ways of the magic or you will die. saysawnay decided to just learn magic but she wanted to know her name but the man said no and to just call him anark, saysawnay said okay and where am i but anark told her the kingdom of crabtoes ignoring the name saysawnay followed the man as he went out the door and asked why she was here and the answer she didnt think of and that was because she needed to kill zanlak or the universe with die and also because you would have died by that stupid demon he said but she was mad at him for saying that but just then the demon broke down the door and tried to kill her and anark said for her to kill the demon as your first task, saysawnay being pissed off she took the anger out on him and started screaming at him and saying shit at him that she probably didnt mean until she relized that the demon is wearing the same stuff as the demon who killed her sister. saysawnay being mad and sad she pulled a knife on him and jumped on him and was fixing to slice his throat but then cried saying that she started to love him but will kill him if i get revenge for my sisters death then crying and cut his throat and the demond started to bleed like a pig being cut in half the man was surprised that she could kill a level 3 demon with no training. anark being surprised and all but ignored that and moved on to what she said but beforwe he could ask about the the body of the demon vanished which isnt normal anymore meaning he wasnt dead and he teleported somewhere, where exactly they did not know but they did know that he was weak right now and they needed to find him fast because no demon knows teleportation magic anymore so they went to the training room and anark teached saysawnay a few spell but it took her a while to get good at casting the tornado spell but she soon got better at it, anark soon begab to relize that she maybe be able to kill the demon but she would need more training so anark got an idea but did not mention it unless she needed it, anark said that he was going to rest but when he left he casted a spell on saysawnay for if she is ever in danger she will get half of the power of the gods for 1 day but then it returns to the gods, saysawnay began training some more and figuring out spells it was about 4 hours later though when anark woke up to a loud noise and that was to his surprise saysawnay creating a portal but the portal over reacted and started eating a wall because she combined it will the alive spell that allowed things that are not alive to come alive. saysawnay was also sucked into the mouth of the portal so much stuff was being sucked into the portal that it looked like it was a black hole so the man made the black hole into a white hole and everything went out. saysawnay said she didnt know what she did and she was practicing summoning and then a portal appeared and the she tried to get rid of it but it came alive, anark understood and said its okay every witch and wizard has a few spells that go wrong just be more careful, okay saysawnay understood but was more curious about the demon so she said to anark she was going out for a bit to explore and he was fine with it but really she was just going out to find the demon so out she went to explore the place and to hope she can find the demon and not because she wanted to kill him no no it was because she wanted to friend him to use him to help kill the more bad like demon and save the world then maybe kill him but down the streets filled with beasts but then she thought to check i n the caves and down to the mountains she went and went she got to the first cave she saw she saw the demon fixing to bleed out so she decided to help not knowing the risk but when she looked closer and asked what happened the demon pulled out a knife and said are you trying to kill me too saysawnay acting confused on what he went asked what do you mean and the demon simply said do you mean you oont know that anark has been trying to kill me since i was 14 years old because i almost killed him on accident with a spell and saysawnay just said you didnt mean to did you, no he said, the why try and kill you, by now he put down the knife and just hugged her with his bloody hands just wanting peace, saysawnay was sad for him, saysawnay asked if he wanted to come with he but the demon just said not and by now the magic inside of him healed him but his voice got darker and darker soon turning into a demonic voice but she just got up and said she will get him some food but before she could go the demon stood up and said that it wasnt just the spell it was because i almost killed him because of and then before she could say what the demon bit her on the neck and said that but then the demon fainted and saysawnay thinking he was just sad and hungry but a few minutes later he woke up and said he was sorry and has been wanting you blood for a while its why i tried to kill you i did not meab to kill your sister but she would have killed me if i didnt im sorry saysawnay understanding but just was curious why he didnt just asked because she would have just given him some blood because she has alot at her home because her brother was a vampire but was hunted down but the demon asked before she could finish thinking if he could have some blood and saysawnay just said sure in a polite and nice tone and the demon hugged her and grabbed her arm and just bit and took alot of blood but before he could wipe his mouth off anark walked in with a sword prepared to kill him but saysawnay said no dont or she wont help kill the other demon, anark knowing she had to said fine but no more blood and he is not staying at my home, the demon was fine with that and when anark left asked saysawnay if she would want to stay with him for a while, saysawnay knowing she still wanted him dead but also knowing he dosnt want anark to hurt her so decided to say sure while walking down the path to his home saysawnay fell in a giant hole it was a small entrance but big in the inside but relized this was a demons home trying to get out she heard someone coming so she went to hide and the demon coming in to help get her out but relized she made a portal up and so they went out before the demon saw but it was to late the demon letting them go because they didnt mean to go but stole a few things from them because they did break in, saysawnay didnt relize the amount of beast people that were there there were all kinds like rabit people, bird people, and all kinds but before she knew it she was there at a giant mansion and she asked if this was his and he said yes and he just said yes and walked in, when she got in it looked even bigger with giant lights and nice painted wood everywhere but then was curious why he didnt just come here when he was hurt but didnt bother asking because be all have are reasons for stuff so she went on exploring but then fell tripping on a box that felt like it was some giant ball she decided to open it curious what it was but when she opened it she saw a head a bloody head and she screamed the second she saw it when the demon saw she found the box she grapped her and through her in a room locking the door with both of them in there the demon pulled out a knife and started to preform blood magic to mess with her mind
